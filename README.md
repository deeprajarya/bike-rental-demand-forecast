### Description

This project focuses on predicting the hourly bike rental demand in a city using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data including weather conditions, time of day, and other relevant factors, the goal is to create accurate predictions that can assist in resource allocation and operational planning for bike rental companies.

### Features

* Utilizes machine learning to forecast hourly bike rental demand.
* Handles various factors such as weather, time, and seasonality.
* Implements exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.

### Data Science Trends

In recent years, data-driven decision making has become essential in various industries, including transportation. Predictive analytics, such as bike rental demand forecasting, allow businesses to optimize operations, improve customer experience, and allocate resources more efficiently. By leveraging machine learning, data scientists can build accurate models that adapt to changing trends and patterns.

### Getting Started

**Prerequisites**
* Python 3.x
* Libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/deeprajarya/BikeRentalForecast.git

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd BikeRentalForecast

3. Install the required libraries:
   pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn

### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Data Loading

Load and examine the training and testing datasets to understand the structure and contents of the data.

* import numpy as np

* import pandas as pd

* train = pd.read_csv('train.csv')

* test = pd.read_csv('test.csv')


### Data Preprocessing

Perform data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values and converting datetime strings to appropriate formats.


### Feature Engineering

Create new features from the datetime column, such as extracting the hour, month, and day of the week. Explore correlations between variables to identify patterns.



### Model Building

**Linear Regression Model**

Train a linear regression model to predict bike rental demand and evaluate its performance using the RMSLE metric.

**Decision Tree Model**

Build a decision tree regressor to predict bike rental demand. Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

**Generating Predictions**

Use the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset and convert log-scale predictions back to the original scale.

**Submission and Evaluation**

Generate a submission CSV file containing the predictions. Evaluate the model's performance using the provided evaluation metrics and submission checker.
